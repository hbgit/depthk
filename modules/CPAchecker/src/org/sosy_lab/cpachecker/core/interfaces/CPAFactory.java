/**
 * Interface for classes which know how to create an instance of one specific
 * CPA.
 *
 * Each class implementing the ConfigurableProgramAnalysis interface has to
 * provide a factory implementing this interface. The CPA class has to have a
 * public static method "factory()" which takes no arguments, returns an instance
 * of CPAFactory and never fails (that is, it never returns null or throws an
 * exception).
 *
 * If the CPA cannot be instantiated for one reason or another (e.g. because
 * not all necessary objects have been provided to the factory), this has to be
 * signaled by an exception returned from the createInstance() method. The only
 * other way in which creating a CPA may fail is when a CPA or its CPAFactory
 * don't support an optional feature (like wrapping another CPA or several of
 * them). The methods of this related to such optional features are marked with
 * an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}. A CPA which does not support a
 * feature should throw such an exception if the method is called (which might
 * not always be the case).
 *
 * All methods except the {@link #createInstance()} method return an instance
 * of CPAFactory. Implementations have to return "this" (that is the very same
 * object on which the method was called) in all cases, to support a programming
 * style like
 * {@code CPA.factory().setLogger(logger).setConfiguration(config).createInstance()}
