This is a small selection of programs from the Original VeriSec Benchmark. The 
complete source can be found at http://se.cs.toronto.edu/index.php/Verisec_Suite
we did not take all the files because some tested cases CPA-Checker does not test
and others were too simple. All files we have chosen were renamed, so the full
path and the subdirecties in the original suite can be found easily.

For our purposes we have inserted asserts in the chosen VeriSec Benchmark files,
so the CPA-Checker is able to work with this Suite, besides that, all files were
preprocessed with Cil 1.3.7.
