/**
 * The Octagon CPA is based on the Octagon Abstract Domain library.
 *
 * The octagon abstract domain is a weakly relational numerical domain. It is
 * based on Difference-Bound Matrices and therefore able to handle
 * constraints of the form <pre> ±X ±Y ≤ c</pre> with <pre>X</pre> and <pre>Y</pre> being variables
 * and <pre>c</pre> being a constant number in the range of the real numbers.  Thus it can be
 * seen as a more specific version of the polyhedron domain, which allows
 * the representation of linear constraints with an arbitrary number of variables.
 *
 * It provides options for both, analysing programs with integer and float variables, whereas
 * the second option drains much more performance.
 *
 * More information on this abstract domain, the implementation, and the evaluation of this CPA
 * can be found at: <b>http://stieglmaier.me/uploads/thesis.pdf</b>
