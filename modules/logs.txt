    - Actual approach. k starts in 1.

        ::: BUG cuz multiples ESBMC_ASSUME from CE.
            - HIP1. Just we should try one ESBMC_ASSUME from CE by P'
                - When we generated a new P' the old ESBMC_ASSUME should be commented
            - [CHOOSE] HIP2. For each P' generated we need to check to up MAX < k >
